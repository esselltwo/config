These are config files I use for Linux things like i3 (window manager) and vim (text editing.)
No promises these are the best!
They are currently set up for mathematics research, which for me means reading PDFs, writing LaTeX, and sometimes working with SageMath

Where things go:
* vimrc goes to ~/.vimrc
* my-snippets goes in ~/.vim/
* the i3 directory goes to ~/.config/i3
* i3/config.bak is the config file autogenerated for my desktop 

Other software required:
* Brightness control uses (light)[https://github.com/haikarainen/light#debianr] because xbacklight wasn't working.

## Warning
The polybar config uses the (siji)[https://github.com/stark/siji] fonts.
For some reason the install script is messed up: if you are installing it (maybe only on a clean system?) you need to remove `/etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf` and then run `fc-cache -rv` to regenerate the font cache.
This is detailed (here)[https://github.com/stark/siji/issues/28].
