These are config files I use for Linux things like i3 (window manager) and vim (text editing.)
No promises these are the best!
They are currently set up for mathematics research, which for me means reading PDFs, writing LaTeX, and sometimes working with SageMath

Where things go:
* vimrc goes to ~/.vimrc
* the i3 directory goes to ~/.config/i3
* i3/config.bak is the config file autogenerated for my desktop 

Other software required:
* Brightness control uses (light)[https://github.com/haikarainen/light#debianr] because xbacklight wasn't working.
